# Sorting Hat

## Goals
This project sorts and assigns users to one of the four houses from Harry Potter. Users can be expelled from Hogwarts, at which point they are "Death Eaters". Enter your name and the Sorting Hat will take care of the rest! Users can also sort filter other users based on house or "Death Eater" status.
